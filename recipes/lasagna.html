    <h3>Homemade mom's lasagna</h3>
    <a>A lasagna is a very good food that I like very much. It all started when I was 8 years old, my dad took me fishing, but the car exploded while we were out there. It was a full moon summer night, a chill breeze of clear air filled my lungs with each breath. Living it the city, even the shit smelled fresh out there. Anyway, since the car exploded we had to walk 20 miles to my grandfather's house. Thankfully, a quantum wormhole opened under our feet and transported us to the night before we left for the trip. We then fought ourselves to the death, replacing them. Ding! Mom's lasagna is ready.</a>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <li>10 ounces lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>3 cups cottage cheese</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons dried parsley</li>
    <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
    <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.</li>

    <li>In a 9x13 inch baking pan, layer noodles, ground beef, tomato sauce mixture and cottage cheese mixture. Two layers of each will fit. Cover with tin foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove tin foil the last 8 minutes of baking time.</li>
